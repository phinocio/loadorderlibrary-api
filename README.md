# Load Order Library API

See the [API Docs](https://docs.loadorderlibrary.com).

Load Order Library is a tool mostly intended to help in debugging/supporting Mod Organizer lists for Bethesda games. It's meant to serve as an alternative/replacement for [Modwatch](https://modwat.ch/). The premiere feature being a list comparison tool.

I have a Patreon I guess. Don't feel the need to contribute or anything, I have no intention of doing perks/goals. If anything, the only thing I care about is covering the costs of the site/server. See https://loadorderlibrary.com/transparency for details.

# Goal

The goal of Load Order Library is to make the life of people doing support for mod lists easier. Often times we ask for an upload to [Modwatch](https://modwat.ch/) and then manually go through the files to determine if a mod is missing, or a mod is added. Whether the ini settings are correct, etc. By using the comparison tool, you get a quick view at a glance at what files are missing/added, and what contents of those files are also missing/added.

# Features

Load Order Library has a slew of features.

-   No registration required. Lists can be uploaded anonymously. You do need an account to edit and delete lists, however. Anonymous ones can't be deleted.
-   Private lists. Only people with the link can view them.
-   For users that decide to register, you can have as many lists as you want.
-   Comparison tool.
-   Completely free. No Ads.

More planned and coming soon!

# Planned Features

Working on a better place for this...for now just check the issues tab on this repo for "enhancement" tags.

# Privacy

Load Order Library uses no analytic services at all, but makes use of Loki/Promtail/Grafana<sup>1</sup> to analyze existing Caddy access logs. Some 3rd party tools are used, but no external requests are made, they are served with the page itself. Files uploaded are on the server until such time they are no longer associated with a list. At which point they are deleted once a week. Files also are in backups until the backup they are in was deleted (backups are created daily and deleted once they are 30 days old).

Data provided is entirely for the use of the site, and does not leave the server except in the case of encrypted database backups. Passwords are hashed and never stored in plain text. The server is hosted via a Digital Ocean droplet located in Toronto, Canada.

<sup>1</sup>The intention behind using this stack to get some basic analytics for the site is so that I have a rough idea of when/if I need to upgrade the server, if there's any IPs spamming my site that I need to block, and so I don't need to use anything like Google Analytics or other privacy invasive options.
